For easiest way to build, open up Terminal to this directory and
run "./build.sh"  Afterwards ArtPaint and it's add-ons will appear
built in the "dist" directory

Note: Only the add-ons in the working folder are built even with
running the makefile "manually"

Before compiling a distribution, remember to set the version in
ArtPaint.rdef ('major', 'middle', 'minor') and windows/AboutWindow.cpp
(string).
