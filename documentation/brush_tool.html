<P>
The image at left top is preview of the brush. The red line beneath the brush shows the scale of the preview. If the line is full width, the brush is in actual size. If the line is half width, the preview is only half of the brush's actual size. The brush can be rotated to different orientations by clicking on its image and moving the mouse.

<DT><STRONG>Rectangle</STRONG>
<DD>When this option is selected, the brush will be rectangle shaped.
<DT><STRONG>Ellipse</STRONG>
<DD>When this option is selected, the brush will be ellipse shaped.
<DT><STRONG>Store Brush</STRONG>
<DD>This button does not change the settings for the brush, but it instead stores the brush to brush-window. Brush-window is explained at the end of this page.
<DT><STRONG>Width</STRONG>
<DD>This option adjusts the width of the brush. The width is measured in pixels
<DT><STRONG>Height</STRONG>
<DD>This option adjusts the height of the brush. The height is measured in pixels.
<DT><STRONG>Fade</STRONG>
<DD>This option adjusts how much the edges of the brush will be faded. The bigger this value is the more the edges will be faded. The fade is not relative to brush size, so fade will affect more a little brush than a big brush.

You can also delete the currently selected brush from the brush-window with the menu-item or by pressing delete-key when the brush-window is active. Figure 2 shows the brush-window.
