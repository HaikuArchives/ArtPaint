<H2>Paint-Window</H2>
The paint-window is the central part of the program where you create the images. It also contains a menu-bar for controlling operations such as saving the image and creating new windows. In figure 1  is a picture of a paint-window.
<P>

</DIV>
<P>
The paint-window is divided into three distinct subsections: the canvas, the status-bar and the menu-bar. In figure 1 the canvas is the white area in the middle of the window. It is used for painting the image. The status-bar is at the bottom of the window. It contains information such as coordinates and selected colors and allows you to also zoom the view and select new colors. The menu-bar can be used to invoke many operations, such as opening new windows and saving the image.
<P>
<H2>The canvas</H2>
The canvas is the area where you can paint your image. When a paint-window is first opened it does not have a canvas. You should select a suitable canvas size and then press the "Create Canvas"-button to create a canvas for the paint-window. Figure 2 shows the controls that are available for settings the size of the canvas.
<P>

<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Figure 2: Controls for settings the canvas size.</CAPTION>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="./images/resize.gif">
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<P>
The size can be selected by settings the numbers in the two fields or by selecting one of the recently used sizes from the pop-up-list on the right. If only an approximate size is needed, it can be quickly selected by dragging the window to the required size.
<P>
When the canvas has been created you can use any of the <A HREF="./painting_tools.html">painting tools</A> to paint on it. The painting tool can be used by pressing down the primary mouse-button. The secondary mouse-button brings up a pop-up-menu where you can change the active tool.
<P>
<H2>The status-bar</H2>
The status-bar is at the bottom of the window and it displays status-information about the current state of the program. Status-bar also contains tools for zooming the image and for selecting <A HREF="./colors.html">colors</A>. Status-bar can be in several different states depending on the state of the program. The different states of the status-bar are listed here:
<DL>
<DT>Canvas not created -mode
<DD><IMG SRC="./images/bar1.gif"><P>
<DT>Normal-mode
<DD><IMG SRC="./images/bar2.gif"><P>
<DT>Transform-mode
<DD><IMG SRC="./images/bar3.gif"><P>
<DT>Add-on-mode
<DD><IMG SRC="./images/bar4.gif"><P>
<DT>Busy-mode
<DD><IMG SRC="./images/bar5.gif"><P>
</DL>
<P>
The canvas not created -mode comes up when the window has no canvas. At this point the status-bar does not offer any functionality. This shows a message at the bottom of the bar. In most modes this place is reserved for helpful messages.
<P>
Normal-mode is the most usual, and it comes up when the canvas has been created. It has the following components (from left to right):
<DL>
<DT>Coordinates-box
<DD>Displays the coordinates that the mouse is over. If the mouse is outside of the image this displays the width and height of the image instead.
<DT>Magnification-box
<DD>Displays the magnification-level of the image. When you click your mouse over this it brings up a slider with which the zooming level can be adjusted freely.
<DT>Magnification-buttons
<DD>Allow you to zoom in and out from the image in predefined steps.
<DT>Selected colors
<DD>Shows the current foreground- and background-<A HREF="./colors.html">color</A>. Clicking on these with the primary mouse button opens up the color-window. Clicking with other mouse buttons exchanges the two colors with each other.
<DT>Color-set
<DD>Displays the current <A HREF="./colors.html">color-set</A>. The two arrows change between different sets. 
</DL>
<P>
Transform-mode comes up when you start an image transformation such as rotation or translation. This mode may also come up with some add-ons. On the right side of the status-bar are two buttons for cancelling and applying the transformation. On their left side are control-views for controlling the transform.
<P>
Add-on mode is similar to normal-mode, but it does not display colors. The status-bar comes to this mode when you have started some add-on or for example when you are adjusting the transparency of the <A HREF="./layers.html">layer</A>.
<P>
Busy-mode comes up when you have selected some operation that is going to take a substantial amount of time. Usually this goes by quite quickly, but depending on the speed of the computer and the size of the image, some operations might take a while. When the status-bar is in this mode you cannot do anything to that image (but you can edit other images if you wish).
<P>
<H2>The menu-bar</H2>
The menu-bar behaves like you would expect from a BeOS application. The following list summarizes the menu-items and describes their functionality.
<P>
<H3>File-menu</H3>

<H2>The title-bar</H2>
Every paint-window has a title-bar like most other windows. The title-bar is shown in the following figure.
<P>
<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>
<TABLE>
<CAPTION ALIGN=BOTTOM>Figure 1: The title-bar.</CAPTION>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="./images/title_bar.jpeg">
</TABLE>
</DIV>
<P>
The title-bar contains three pieces of information. The star on the left tells that the project has been changed since it was last saved. The 'Untitled - 2' is the name of the project, which in this case is still unnamed. When the project is saved to disk this will change to reflect that. The 'pic00007.jpg' is the name of the picture that this project was last saved to or loaded from.
