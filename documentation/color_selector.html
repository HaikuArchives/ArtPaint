<H2>Color Selector -tool</H2>
Color selector -tool selects colors from the image. It is used by clicking on the image over the color that needs to be selected. The selected color will then become the new foreground-color. If the mouse is moved over the image while the button is held down, a window will pop up showing in RGB-coordinates the color that is under the cursor.
