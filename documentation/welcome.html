ArtPaint is a painting and image-processing tool for the BeOS &mdash; and now for Haiku. It offers a lot of functionality for both generating new images and manipulating existing ones. As an example of what ArtPaint can do all images in this document were created or manipulated with it.

The main features of ArtPaint include a comprehensive set of painting-tools and real-time preview for many image-manipulating operations. The key design principle has been to let the user see what he is doing instead of just forcing him to type in some numbers and then hoping that the result will not be too far from the expected.

ArtPaint's functionality is not well served by describing it with words. For that reason I suggest that you now put this documentation away and start playing with the program. After you have made yourself comfortable with the program you may find that you'd like to know a little more about it. In that case the other chapters in this document might help you.
