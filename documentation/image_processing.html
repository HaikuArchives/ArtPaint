<H2>Image Processing</H2>

This section describes the basic image-processing operations available in ArtPaint. Most of the operations can be applied to a single layer or to all layers at the same time. Note that much of the image-processing functionality is in the <A HREF="./add_ons.html">add-ons</A> which are described separately. 
<P>
<H3>Rotation</H3>
Rotation is an operation which changes the orientation of the image. Two parameters need to be supplied: the center of rotation (by default is the center of the image) and the angle of rotation. The center of rotation can be adjusted by clicking on the cross that appears on the image and dragging it to another location (it can be changed also by using the secondary mouse-button). The angle can be set by clicking on the image with the primary mouse-button and moving the cursor around. The angle can also be set by entering a number in the text-field in the right side of the status-bar. After the proper rotation is set it can be confirmed with the OK-button on the status-bar. The rotation can also be confirmed by starting some other image processing operation. If the rotation is not what is wanted it can be cancelled from the Cancel-button on the status-bar.

<H3>Translation</H3>
Translation is an operation which moves the image to another location. Two parameters need to be supplied: translation in x-direction and translation in y-direction. These can be adjusted by clicking on the image and dragging the mouse. They can also be adjusted with the text-fields in the right side of the status-bar. . After the proper translation is set it can be confirmed with the OK-button on the status-bar. The translation can also be confirmed by starting some other image processing operation. If the translation is not what is wanted it can be cancelled from the Cancel-button on the status-bar.

<H3>Scaling</H3>
Scaling changes the size of the image. When this operation is applied, a window is opened that contains controls for settings the new dimensions of the image. The window also contains a checkbox labeled "Lock Proportions". Checking this button forces the scaling to be proportional in x- and y-directions. In addition to adjusting the dimension from the controls in the window, they can be adjusted by clicking on the image and moving the mouse. If the checkbox is unchecked both dimensions can be scaled independently of each other. The scaling can be confirmed by pressing the OK-button in the scaling-window. If there are any <A HREF="./selections.html">selections</A> made they will be cleared when the scaling is done. The scaling operation applies to all layers at once.

<H3>Cropping</H3>
Cropping changes the positions of the borders of the image. When this operation is applied, a window is opened that contains controls for settings the new border locations. Also the borders are drawn on the image and they can be moved to set the new border locations. Cropping can be used not only to make the image smaller, but also to extend it. The cropping can be confirmed by pressing the OK-button in the cropping-window. If there are any <A HREF="./selections.html">selections</A> made they will be cleared when the cropping is done. The cropping operation applies to all layers at once.

<H3>Flipping</H3>
Flipping flips the image either horizontally or vertically. Flipping is like having an image on a transparent slide and flipping it over. Currently this operation does not care about <A HREF="./selections.html">selections</A>, but this will change in the future however.

<H3>Changing Layer Transparency</H3>
Although changing the layer transparency is not strictly an image-processing operation, it is documented here. This operation changes the overall transparency of the currently active layer and it does not care about the selections.
