<H2>Ellipse-tool</H2>
The ellipse-tool is used to draw filled and outlined ellipses to the image. It is used by pressing down the mouse-button and dragging the mouse around. A preview of the ellipse is rendered on the screen and when the mouse-button is released, the actual ellipse is drawn.
[There is currently a bug in Haiku's drawing algorithm that causes 'trails' to be left behind by this action.  A zoom or other change in the display will remove these.]
