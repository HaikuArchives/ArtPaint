<H2>Straight Line -tool</H2>
The straight line -tool allows the drawing of straight lines. The tool is used by pressing the mouse-button down on the starting point of the line and releasing it at the wanted endpoint.
[There is currently a bug in Haiku's drawing algorithm that causes 'trails' to be left behind by this action.  A zoom or other change in the display will remove these.]
