<H2>Text-tool</H2>
Text-tool is used to insert text into the image. The text-tool is used by clicking on the image at the location where the inserted text is wanted. This brings up a window for adjusting the appearance of the text. This window is documented at the end of this page.
<H3>Settings</H3>
Text-tool has no settings.
<H3>Text Tool Window</H3>
The text tool window is shown in figure 1. It contains a text-area at the top where the text can be written. Below that is a pop-up-menu for selecting the font type. Then there are sliders for adjusting the size, rotation and shear of the text. Finally at the bottom is a checkbox for enabling or disabling anti-aliasing for the text.

<P>
The color of the text can be set with the color-window. Whenever the text tool window is open, all color adjusting done in the color-window will be reflected in the text-color. If only part of the text needs to be colored, it can be selected in the text-area.
[Note that the color the text is drawn in is not automatically the current foreground color.  The color-window must be <i>adjusted</i> to change the text.]
<P>
The text can be moved around by clicking on the image and moving the mouse around. The rotation can also be adjusted by clicking on the image with the secondary mouse-button and moving the mouse.
