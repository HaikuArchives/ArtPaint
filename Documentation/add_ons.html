<H2>Add-ons</H2>
<p>
Much of ArtPaint's functionality comes through add-ons. Add-ons are 
small programs that ArtPaint can load to do some specific job. 
The add-ons can be accessed through 
<A HREF="./paint_window.html">paint-window</A>'s Add-Ons-menu. Currently 
all add-ons affect only one <A HREF="./layers.html">layer</A> at a 
time.

<H3>Descriptions of the included add-ons</H3>
This part briefly describes the add-ons that are included with the 
current version.

<DL>
<DT><b>Adaptive Histogram Equalization</b>
<DD>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization#Contrast_Limited_AHE">
<i>Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization</i></a>
algorithm that can improve contrast in a Greyscale image.
A colour image will be converted to greyscale before the
algorithm is applied.
<DT><b>Anti-Dither</b>
<DD>Attempts to reverse the effects of dithering an image.
It will considerably reduce the resolution. 
<DT><b>Blur</b>
<DD>Opens a window that allows you to adjust the blurriness of the 
image with a slider. The blur is reflected on the image when you let 
go of the slider.
<DT><b>Brightness</b>
<DD>Opens a window that allows you to adjust the brightness of the 
image with a slider. The change in brightness is reflected on the 
image right when you move the slider.
<DT><b>Color Balance</b>
<DD>Opens a window that has three sliders for controlling the amount 
of red, green and blue color in the image. The change in 
color-balance is reflected in the image at the moment you move the 
sliders.
<DT><b>Color Separator</b>
<DD>Extracts the Cyan, Magenta, Yellow or Key/Black components
of an image.  Only useful to make colour separations for printing.
<DT><b>Contrast</b>
<DD>Opens a window that has a slider for adjusting the contrast of 
the image. The change in contrast is reflected in the image right away.
<DT><b>Detect Edges</b>
<DD>The resultant image will be black except for the exact edges,
which will have highlighted colour.  Note: it does not change transparency. 
<DT><b>Dispersion</b>
<DD>Changes the pixels positions in the image randomly a little bit 
to create a "dispersed" look.
<DT><b>Emboss</b>
<DD>Creates an emboss effect on the image.
<DT><b>Enhance Edges</b>
<DD>Increases colour "distance" at edges 
<DT><b>Gaussian Blur</b>
<DD>Blurs the image using a Gaussian function;
see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">
Wikipedia article</a> 
<DT><b>Greyscale</b>
<DD>Converts the image into greyscale.
<DT><b>Halftone</b>
<DD>Creates a halftone-pattern on the image. The foreground-color is 
used to color the dots and the background-color fills the background.
<DT><b>Interference</b>
<DD>Generates a "Wave Interference Pattern" from two "point sources" in
a layer.  The location of the sources can be adjusted with the mouse.
Any original image in the layer and colour settings are completely ignored. 
<DT><b>Marble</b>
<DD>Overlays a random "Marble" effect on the image, using the
foreground colour. 
<DT><b>Negative</b>
<DD>Creates a negative image of the picture by inverting every color. 
The inversion is done in RGB-color-space
<DT><b>Oil</b>
<DD>Creates a pattern on the image that tries to simulate the effect 
of painting the image with brush strokes.
<DT><b>Polar Mapper</b>
<DD>Generates a rectangular-coordinate image from the polar coordinates
of the original.  Useful in some image analysis schemes.  If <b>R</b> is
the distance from the centre of the original image, and <b>&theta;</b> is
the angle from the <b>x</b>-axis, the resultant <b>x = log R</b> and
<b>y = &theta;</b>. 
<DT><b>Reducer</b>
<DD>Reduces the number of colours used in an image to a specified maximum.
The result may be dithered with a variety of algorithms.  The palette
used may be the 256-colour BeOS (and Haiku) map, or a generated optimal one
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm">
<i>Generalized Lloyd's Algorithm</i></a>. (The latter may be very slow,
so an indication is posted in the control window while it is active.)
<DT><b>Saturation</b>
<DD>Opens a window that contains a slider for controlling the 
saturation of the image. The effect is reflected on the image right 
when the slider is moved.
<DT><b>Sharpness</b>
<DD>Changes the (apparent) sharpness of the image. 
<DT><b>Stretch Histogram</b>
<DD>Improves the contrast of the image by stretcing its histogram to 
maximum possible length. If the image contains pure black and pure 
white this operation will do nothing.
<DT><b>Threshold</b>
<DD>Generates a new image with all the pixels of the original that were
lighter than the specified threshold in the foreground colour,
and those less than the threshold in the background colour.
The threshold is set by clicking or dragging the mouse in the
histogram area of the panel.  (Takes effect on mouse-button release.)
You can select on overall intensity, or specifically
on Red, Green, or Blue.
<DT><b>Twirl</b>
<DD>Makes a twirl-effect on the image. Opens a window with two 
sliders for controlling the size and the direction of the twirl. The 
center for the twirl can be set by clicking on the image and dragging 
around.
<DT><b>Wave</b>
<DD>Creates a circular wave effect on the image. Opens a window that 
controls sliders for controlling the length and the strength of the 
wave. The wave center can be adjusted by clicking on the image with 
the mouse and dragging around.
<DT><b>Wood</b>
<DD>Creates a wood-like texture over the image.

<H3>Adding add-ons</H3>
The suite of add-ons is not fixed, and new ones might be created
in the future.  You can in fact make your own; it was once intended
that there should be a Developer's kit, but it never actually arrived.
For now, the best bet would be to go to the master source archives at
<a href="https://github.com/HaikuArchives/ArtPaint/"> HaikuArchives</a>,
and look at how the current set have been coded.
<p>
If you installed ArtPaint as a Haiku Package, its folders will be
read-only, so a new add-on currently can't just be plugged in directly
&mdash; unless it is also supplied as a package, in which case just drag
that to <i>/boot/system/packages</i>.  Otherwise you would have to
copy the ArtPaint folder to be run from some writeable area and put
the add-on in the "add-ons" subfolder there.
