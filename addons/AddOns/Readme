These files contain a basic core for building an add-on that is based on Manipulator-class. You should do the following things to make the add-on:

	1.	Duplicate this directory so that you do not lose this template when you start modifying it

	2.	Rename the files Template.h and Template.cpp to myaddon.h and myaddon.cpp, where
		myaddon is a name that you have chosen. Also rename the Template.proj.

	3.	Open the project

	4.	Add the file myaddon.cpp to the project

	5.	For myaddon.h and myaddon.cpp search and replace the following things:
		- replace $MANIPULATOR_NAME with the name for your manipulator-class
		- replace $MENU_NAME with the name that you want to be in the menu for this add-on
		- replace $HEADER_NAME with myaddon.h where myaddon.h is the name that you chose
		- replace $MENU_HELP_TEXT with a text that you want to be shown in the status-bar
		  while this add-ons menu-item is selected

	6.	Change the exported add-on-type to be proper

	7.	Change the information in the first few lines of myaddon.h and myaddon.cpp

	8.	Change the $ifdef and #define in myaddon.h from TEMPLATE_H to your liking
		 
	9.	Change the returned string in ReturnName-function

	10.	Implement the ManipulateBitmap-function

	11.	Change the name for the file in projects settings to your liking

	12.	Compile

	13.	Move the resulting file to directory ArtPaint/add-ons. You can also add the shell commads
		needed for moving to the file script.sh, where they will be executed automatically right
		after linking has finished.
