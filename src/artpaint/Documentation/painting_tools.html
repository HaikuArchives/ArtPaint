<H2>Painting Tools</H2>
Painting tools are the most important tools when creating new images. They are also useful when modifying existing images or manipulating for example scanned images. This section describes how the painting tools can be used and what options are available for each painting tool. What can be done with the painting tools is only limited by the user's imagination. However some tools fit to some jobs better than others.
<P>
At any given moment only one painting-tool can be active. Active means that pressing the mouse-button on the image starts drawing with that tool. All of the paint-windows share the same tool. The active tool can be changed by two different methods: by clicking on the image with the secondary mouse-button and selecting the tool from the appearing pop-up-menu, or from the tool selection window. The tool selection window is pictured below. From this picture you can examine a tool closer by clicking on its icon. The tool selection window can be resized to have the tools in a single row or a column or something in between.

<P>
To select a tool from the tool selection window, just click on its icon with the primary mouse-button. By clicking on  the icon with the secondary mouse-button you can bring up the tool-settings window. The tool-settings window allows you to change the settings for the active tool. It is described in detail in the tool-sections.
